            pathfinding algorithms

          , both for the author and for you, by means of visualization. Crudely
          speaking, pathfinding algorithms are algorithms that searches for a
          path between two points (in this case the start node and the
          destination node). These pathfinding algorithms have found their uses
          in many fields such as navigation, search algorithms, game design etc.
          This project is written by the handsome young man in Figure 1.1 and is
          inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu's video which you can watch by clicking{" "}
